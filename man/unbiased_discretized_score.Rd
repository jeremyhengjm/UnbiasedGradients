\item{observations}{a matrix of observations of size terminal_time x ydimension}

\item{nparticles}{number of particles}

\item{resampling_threshold}{ESS proportion below which resampling is triggered (always resample at observation times by default)}

\item{initialization}{choice of distribution to initialize chains, such as \code{dynamics} or the default \code{particlefilter}}

\item{algorithm}{character specifying type of algorithm desired, i.e. 
\code{\link{CPF}} for conditional particle filter, 
\code{\link{CASPF}} for conditional ancestor sampling particle filter,
\code{\link{CBSPF}} for conditional backward sampling particle filter}

\item{k}{iteration at which to start averaging (default to 0)}

\item{m}{iteration at which to stop averaging (default to 1)}

\item{max_iterations}{iteration at which to stop the while loop (default to infinity)}
